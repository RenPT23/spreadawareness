    <h2>Hey there,</h2>
    <h3>So yeah, we’re all just trying to fight some greedy asses</h3>
    <p>Corruption and greed in governments aren’t just random fuck-ups—they’re everywhere and cause serious damage. For example, in Greece, bribery scandals in the public sector have drained the economy by up to €14 billion a year. That’s insane, right?</p>
    <p>And in Yemen, systemic corruption has created ghost workers and left public services in shambles, messing up the country’s stability and development.</p>
    <p>Seriously, it’s like these assholes don’t give a damn about anyone but themselves.</p>
    <p>If you still dont know about the KOSA situtation youre fucking living under a rock here you can watch it without YouTube!</p>
